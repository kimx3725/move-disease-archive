If you prefer that we complete Steps A1–A5 for you, please contact support@movebank.org or kimx3725@umn.edu.\n\nA1. Create a study with complete study details\nEach dataset must be associated with a clearly described study in Movebank. If your study already exists in Movebank, review the Study Details to confirm that all required fields are complete and accurate. These details support discoverability, proper attribution, and informed collaboration.\n\n\nA2. Set permissions for the study\nContributors retain full control over access to their data. Movebank users should review and configure their study’s visibility and download permissions to reflect their intended level of data sharing (e.g., summary-only access, public tracks, or downloadable data).\n\n\nA3. Import location data into the study\nUpload tracking data to your Movebank study using either manual file uploads or automated data feeds from supported tag manufacturers. Ensure that the uploaded data matches the Movebank formatting and quality standards.\n\n\nA4. Add reference data to the study\nReference data provide essential context for interpreting movement data, such as animal characteristics, tag information, and deployment details. At a minimum, studies should include standardized identifiers and basic biological metadata as outlined in the MDA’s data standards (see some of our worked examples).\n\n\nA5. Add “MoveDiseaseArchive” user as a collaborator\nOnce your study is complete, add the “MoveDiseaseArchive” user as a collaborator (instructions can be found here. This allows the archive curators to index and display your study as part of the Move Disease Archive.\n\n\nA6. Complete the participation agreement and submission form\nComplete the participation agreement form to formally submit your study to the archive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you encounter issues, contact Dongmin (Dennis) Kim at kimx3725@umn.edu or, for technical issues, Movebank support at support@movebank.org."

    "text": "The Move Disease Archive (MDA) is a global collection of eco-epidemiological datasets that integrate animal movement and other animal-borne sensor data with diagnostic information (e.g., swabs, blood samples) from infected and susceptible wildlife. The archive serves as a resource for researchers seeking to understand how pathogens influence animal behavior, infection spread, and the risk of spillover to domestic animals and humans.\nAs of November 2025, the MDA is being developed in collaboration with Movebank, the Move Biodiversity Observation Network (Move BON), Euromammals, and Verena Institute to support long-term FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data stewardship for wildlife health and disease surveillance (Wilkinson et al. 2016)."

    "section": "Why a Disease Archive for Animal Movement?",
    "text": "Why a Disease Archive for Animal Movement?\nWildlife plays an important role in the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, both as hosts and as sources of zoonotic pathogens that threaten human and livestock health. Climate change and shifting species distributions further intensify these risks by altering contact and movement patterns and reshaping pathogen dynamics across ecosystems. Understanding disease dynamics in wildlife populations is crucial for conservation and for reducing the risk of pathogen spillover to livestock and people. However, detecting and monitoring infections in free-ranging animals remains a challenge. Traditional sampling offers only snapshots in time and often misses key stages of infection. Because pathogens can alter host movement, space use, and activity patterns, a collection of infected animal movement data provides a promising tool for disease surveillance. The MDA supports a transferable approach to real-time monitoring of infection in free-ranging wildlife by linking animal movement data and disease-related data such as diagnostic test results and mortality records. The MDA brings together movement ecologists, disease ecologists, and veterinarians to build an early-warning system for wildlife health and support research at the interface of movement and disease ecology."

This will make the MDA more widely accessible and facilitate data quality control and processing. For assistance organizing your data on Movebank, contact support@movebank.org and kimx3725@umn.edu. If you are not able to store data on Movebank or another repository, please contact us. In addition to organizing data within Movebank or a similar repository, participation requires:\n-Studies remain publicly discoverable, and owners are open to considering collaboration requests. They do not need to be publicly downloadable.\n-Data meet basic quality standards, including accurate formatting and sufficient metadata (See our Data Standards and Submission Guide).\n-Owner contact information remains up to date, particularly for studies that are not publicly accessible.\nOnce your data are ready, please complete the MDA Participation Agreement, after which your study will be reviewed and added to the list of participating projects.\n\n\nData users\nThe MDA facilitates access to global eco-epidemiological datasets that pair animal movement with diagnostic information from infected and susceptible wildlife. These resources support research on how pathogens influence animal behavior, infection dynamics, and potential spillover risks to domestic animals and humans. The MDA does not redistribute raw disease or animal-tracking data. All datasets remain under the control of the original data providers, and the MDA functions as a discovery and access platform. Researchers are directed to data owners and must comply with their licensing and ethical requirements prior to use.\nThe archive is designed to support a wide range of beneficial uses, including:\n-Studies of infection-driven behavioral change\n-Improved understanding of pathogen transmission and spread\n-Wildlife health monitoring through biologging\n-Eco-epidemiological modeling\n-Conservation and management of disease-affected species\n-Education and public engagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAs with all Movebank-hosted data, the MDA includes both public and controlled-access studies. We strongly encourage users to contact data owners about proposed uses, as they can offer critical ecological and diagnostic context. Please also review Movebank’s terms of use and user agreement.
